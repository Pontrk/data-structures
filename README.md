# data-structures
Implemented and conducted performance measurements for operations such as element addition, element removal, and element search in the following data structures:
a) Array,
b) Doubly linked list,
c) Binary heap (maximum type - maximum element at the root).
the basic element of the structures is a 4-byte signed integer.
All data structures are dynamically allocated (data is reallocated when adding/removing elements).
For the array and linked list, operations of adding and removing elements have been separately considered at the following positions:
a. Beginning of the array/linked list
b. End of the array/linked list
c. Any position in the array/linked list (specified as a parameter in the respective function).
